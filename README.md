## bb-e-usd liquid dollar extraction POC

### Concept
This script runs in a fork of mainnet and simulates emergency withdrawing all everything back to non-bpt tokens in the addresses internal vault balances.  Then it withdraws all DAI, USDC, and USDT from the balance.  It can be run on any address to print a report, and the resulting JSON should work with any gnosis-safe multisig that has bbeUSD in it.  It has not been tested with other tokens.  

#### IMPORTANT
This is A Proof of Concept and Development Work.  You should only use this if you are thinking a lot.  Take the time to simulate in tenderly and understand the resulting outputs if you are going to execute a payload generated by this script.   No one takes any responsibilty at all for your actions when using this code.

Please contact Tritium or the Balancer Maxis if you have questions or would like help understanding the tenderly sim.

### How do i do it

Recommend using Python 3.9.  You can install it on a mac with homebrew `brew install python@3.9`

You will also need ganahce-cli installed.  `npm install ganache-cli`

Install dependancies.  You can setup a venv if you want
```bash
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3.9 install requirements.txt
```
Edit the script in [scripts/extractInFork.py](scripts/extractInFork.py) and change the address of multisig to your address.  It doesn't have to be a multisig to run the simulation, but you can only load the resulting payload into a gnosis safe.

Check all the other addresses and make sure they make sense/you understand.

Review the script breifly and make sure that no other addresses are used and you understand to at least this level.

Run the script from the scripts directory
```bash
cd scripts
brownie run --network mainnet-fork scripts/extractInFork.py
```

It should print a bunch of stuff, and at the end a report that looks something lke this:
```text
*** Final report.
BPTS burnt: 375523826997996321598041
USDC in:61995.513759
USDT in:4.080702
DAI in: 64590.65470597399
```

A file will be created called EulerBreakoutOutput.json.  If the address provided as multisig was a multisig, you can load this into transaction builder and simulate the results on tenderly.  Once loaded into the safe, the transaction is reasonably easy to read.
