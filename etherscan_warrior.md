# But wait ser
As per [BIP-299](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-299-permissioned-arbitrage-to-recover-remaining-funds-in-bb-e-usd/4783) the remaining value of bb-e-usd has been arbed out of the pool by the DAO.

Further notice here will be posted about the governance to follow which will distribute the proceeds of this action to remaining bb-e-USD hodlers at the time of the arbitrage.

Running this now will render no value and just cost gas.

# Burning your bb-e-usd for the etherscan warrior
There's a lot of steps here, but you can do it.  Good luck.  The ability to do this all via the UI is comming soon.  If you get stuck you will be able to finish with the UI later.  Make VERY SURE to always enter your own address as the **sender** and **recipient** in the etherscan transactions and you're tokens will remain in your possesion.  No approvals are required.

You should get arounnd 32 to 33 cents per bb--e-usd out.  The USDT burns to very little withdrawabele tokens and is really in no case worth the gas.


### Following the TX
This guide was built using some bb-e-usd in Tritums Multisginer Wallet.  Links and detailed screenshots for each transaction from the test are provided.  Tritium uses Rabby Wallet.

## Prep Work
Withdraw all bb-e-usd composite tokens (paired with reth, wsteth, temple, dola) using the UI such that you have the most bb-e-usd you could ever have.

## Step 1: Emergency Exit bb-e-usd 

Go to the Pool page for [bb-e-usd](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x50cf90b954958480b8df7958a9e965752f62712400000000000000000000046f)
Withdraw all your bb-e-usd proportionally:

## Step 2: Emergency Exit linear pool tokens to internal balances

You just withdrew [bb-e-usdc](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xd4e7c1f3da1144c9e2cfd1b015eda7652b4a439900000000000000000000046a), [bb-e-dai](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x50cf90b954958480b8df7958a9e965752f62712400000000000000000000046f), and [bb-e-usdt](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3c640f0d3036ad85afa2d5a9e32be651657b874f00000000000000000000046b).
You can view your balances on those links, but you will not be able to withdraw because the e-tokens are not-transferrable causing the contract to revert.  In the next week or 2 the UI will be extended to allow you to withdraw to internal balances, breaking the LP while avoiding an ERC20 transfer of e-tokens.  For now you can do this in etherscan as follows:

### bb-e-usdc
Go to [bb-e-usdc](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd4e7c1f3da1144c9e2cfd1b015eda7652b4a4399#readContract) on etherscan.  

Run function 3. Balance of specifying your address.  Copy this number.
![img_6.png](images/img_6.png)

Go to https://abi.hashex.org/.  Select Function Constructor, and add 2 arguments:

| type    | value                    |
|---------|--------------------------|
| uint8   | 255                      |
| uint256 | balance from step above  |

Copy the encoded data or leave this window open:

Go to the [vault](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8#writeContract) on etherscan.

Run the function exitPool with the following settings:

Note that you received no tokens.  You can now find and withdraw internal balances using a [Alpha Version of a tool created by Balancer Contributors](https://tools.balancer.blue/internalmanager)

### bb-e-usdt
There's not enough to make it worth the gas.  If you want to waste money/play around, you can get the token list by querying getTokenList with the poolId of the bb-e-usdt pool on the vault.

Here is an example of 4 USDT comming out of a 375k burn in the POC.  The gas costs include 1 tx to withdraw the linear pool token to internal balances and 1 tx to withdraw the USDT:
```
=*** Final report.
BPTS burnt: 375523.8269979963
USDC in: 61995.513759
USDT in: 4.080702
DAI in: 64590.65470597399
```

### Step 3: Withdrawing your stablecoins
Go the [Alpha Version of the Internal Balancer tool created by Balancer Contributors](https://tools.balancer.blue/internalmanager)

Connect your wallet, you will be able to see and withdraw your internal balances there.

Here are the internal balances of the wallet used. There was another other experiment with burning bb-e-usd to internal balances, but the DAI and USDC amounts shown, are the outputs you can expect to withdraw from this operation:

![img.png](images/img.png)



`32.99 USDC + 34.38 DAI = 67.37 USD` out from an original `199.87` bb-e-usd burned = 33.7 cents out per BPT in. 

The e-tokens, while worthless, remain in your possession as an internal vault balance.  They could be withdrawn in the future if Euler ever unfreezes the tokens.
